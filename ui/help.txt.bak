    "FAQ #1-\n"
    "Q: There's people cheating and joining the other team!  What's going on?\n"
    "A: There are admins who have permission to edit OC's.  They are not literally cheating.\n"
          "- These admins cannot earn any hiscores, stats, and they cannot win.\n"
    "\n"
    "FAQ #2-\n"
    "Q: What is speedmode?\n"
    "A: speedmode sets your speed to your current flySpeed.  flySpeed can be set\n"
          "- by setting cg_flySpeed.  For OC mods < v2.0, if your client does not\n"
          "- have cg_flySpeed, you\n"

          "- higher than 100\n"
    "\n"
    "FAQ #3-\n"
    "Q: How do I disable the annoying tesla sound?\n"
    "A: Open your console, and type '/set cg_disableWeaponSounds tesla/idle1.wav'\n"
    "\n"
    "FAQ #4-\n"
    "Q: Can I measure my speed or time?\n"
    "A: Yes.  See ''Options->Controls->OC'' for OC mods >= v2.0.  For OC mods <= v2.0, use '/speedometer' and '/OCTime' to toggle the center-print speedometer and OC timer respectively.\n"
    "\n"
    "FAQ #5-\n"
    "Q: Can I beat an obstacle course without spoiling any solutions?\n"
    "A: Yes, type ''/hide'' in console to hide yourself from non-admin players.  Use the same\n"
        "- command to unhide yourself.\n"
    "\n"
    "FAQ #6-\n"

    "There are three different types of jump movement in Tremulous:\n"
    "1) After jumping, the Z axis is constant\n"
    "3) After jumping, the Z axis is never negative\n"
    "2) After jumping, the Z axis is not constant\n"
    "\n"
    "The first type listed is used in most Tremulous 1.1.0 servers.  Height is never gained nor lost\n"
    "\n"
    "The second type listed is used by some of the most recent development servers,\n"
    "MercenariesGuild included.  With this movement type, height can be gained, but it is never lost\n"
    "\n"
    "The third time is the least common movement type.  It is usually used by a small\n"
    "number of development servers.  Height is not restricted.  This mode adds more\n"
    "realism to the game and opens many possibities for reaching special places and\n"
    "areas.  The OC server uses this movement.\n"
    "\n"
    "Because of the method we believe is best for movement itself, velocity and\n"
slopes will affect the height gained or lost.  The faster you are,"
the more your height will be affected.  The steeper the slope is, the more"
    "height is be affected.  If you jump running up a slope, you will gain\n"
    "height.  If you jump running down a slope, you will lose height.  As a beginner,\n"
    "try to get a lot of distance before jumping to practice gaining speed on a\n"
    "slope.\n"
    "\n"
    "--CROUCHING IN AIR--\n"
    "\n"
    "Another fundamental move is commonly referred to as 'crouch jumping'.  Crouch\n"
    "jumping is performed by pressing the jump key, releasing the jump key, and\n"
    "pressing and holding down the crouch key.  It is a common beginner's mistake\n"
    "to hold down the jump key while pressing the crouch key.  You cannot crouch\n"
    "while you are pressing jump key.  If your jump key is bound to spacebar and your\n"
    "crouch key is bound to 'c', you will only crouch when 'c' is pressed and\n"
    "spacebar is not.  Crouch jumping can be difficult to learn at first, but it\n"
    "becomes second nature after practice.\n"
    "\n"
    "--BUNNY HOPPING--\n"
    "\n"
    "Bunny hopping is pretty straightforward and easy to do, but can often\n"
    "be difficult to time when combining bunny hopping with other advanced movements.\n"
    "To bunny hop, press space any amount of time before you land, and release\n"
    "and press again immediately after you jump (assuming you have jump bound to\n"
    "spacebar).  As long as space is pressed when and for each time you touch a\n"
    "solid surface, you will jump.  To help you understand this, try standing in one place\n"
    "and press space twice quickly.  Press and release space the first time\n"
    "immediately, but hold it down and do not release it the second time.  Regardless\n"
    "of time at which you press it the second time, you'll jump as long as it's pressed (without crouch\n"
    "pressed).\n"
    "\n"
    "--ACCELERATION--\n"
    "\n"
    "There are several methods that you can use to accelerate.  The most common\n"
    "methods are: slightly turning the camera, immediately changing direction of\n"
    "movement by 45o, and pouncing as a Dragoon.  Walking on the ground will\n"
    "cause your velocity to return to 320.\n"

  {
    "--LAYOUT NAMES\n"
    "\n"
    "The filename of a course (typically oc.dat) determines the type of it.\n"
    "Certain flags are recognized.  For example, since the 'o' flag\n"
    "enables players to only need to use one armoury to win, a layout with name of \n"
    "oco.dat will enable players to do that.  Note that the first two characters ('oc')\n"
    "are ignored when flags are determined.  You can also append a suffix in which\n"
    "no characters will be interpreted as a flag by adding a '_'.  Everything after the\n"
    "first '_' will not be read as a flag.  For example, we could have noted that\n"
    "the course only has medis in it by layoutsaving it as 'oco_medisonly' (which\n"
    "would create the file oc_medisonly.dat)\n"

    "\n"
    "For OC mod versions <  2.0, you're only option is to connect to a special server\n"
    "running the OC mod in editoc (development) mode.\n"
    "\n"
    "For OC mod versions >= 2.0, you can also simply start your Tremulous client, select\n"
    "'mods', and select 'oc'.  Then load a map using the console, usually with '/devmap'\n"
    "(enable all cheats) if you're working alone, or '/map' (enable some cheats only\n"
    "if the player can edit the OC) if you have other people testing.\n"
    "\n"
    "This server is running version ${g_version}\n"
    "\n"
    "--START BUILDING--\n"
    "\n"
    "To start building a NEW OC:\n"
    "1: Load the map (with '/devmap' or '/map')\n"
    "2: Save the INITIAL LAYOUT without building anything by\n"
        "- using '!layoutsave layoutname', where layoutname\n"
        "- is a valid OC layout name (see '^2!info layout^7').\n"
        "- You should usually use 'oc' as the layoutname,\n"
        "- since you can change it later.\n"
    "3: '!restart layoutname'\n"
    "4: '!editoc 1' to enable admins to edit OC's, or '!editoc 2' to enable\n"
        "- everybody to edit OC's.\n"
    "5: Start building.  In the future, you'll be able to continue working on\n"
        "- it by following the below instructions.\n"
    "\n"
    "To continue building an OC on which you have already begun working:\n"
    "1: Load the map (with '/devmap' or '/map')\n"
    "2: '!listlayouts' to see your layout's name in case you forgot it.\n"
    "3: '!restart layoutname'\n"
    "\n"
    "--BUILDING THE OC--\n"
    "\n"
    "An OC will need at least a method of spawning (by building an egg or telenode),\n"
    "and at least one medi or armoury.\n"
    "\n"
    "Check that there are no existing similar OC's for the same map.  If there is\n"
    "another OC of the same or similar type, make sure that yours is much better or much different,\n"
    "otherwise you might not have much luck getting your obstacle course accepted.  One possible\n"
    "exception is extending or improving an existing OC.\n"
    "\n"
    "Try to fill as much of the map as you can (without exceeding the 1024-4096 or so\n"
    "buildable limit, of course), to the extent deemed reasonable.  Courses that leave\n"
    "large portions of the map without buildables will most likely not be accepted.\n"
    "\n"
    "It pretty much boils down to common sense; there's really not many restrictions\n"
    "aside from the load the server can handle.\n"
    "\n"
    "But most importantly, try not to be too repetitive, mainly with existing courses.\n"
    "These tend to become uninteresting.  When options run low, making a map yourself\n"
    "is always an option.\n"
    "\n"
    "\n"
    "You can manually power or unpower a buildable by setting its ''group''.  Use\n"
    "'/groupUp' and '/groupDown' to change a buildable's group, or '/group' to\n"
    "see the buildable's current group without changing it.  Group 2 is unpowered,\n"
    "group 1 is powered, and group 0 buildables will use default tremulous behaviour\n"
    "to determine its power.  Telenodes are grouped for teleportation.  When a telenode\n"
    "is used, the player will be teleported to the closest telenode in the same group, or\n"
    "if none exist, nothing happens.  If telenodes are in group 0, they are used for spawning\n"
    "humans, and will not teleport.  Grouping has no effect on eggs.  Telenodes and eggs\n"
    "by default use group 0, and everything else has a default of group 2.\n"
    "\n"
    "Use '/buildableOverride' to toggle buildableOverride.  With buildable override enabled,\n"
    "you can build inside of walls, stack buildables, and build inside of other buildables.\n"
    "When buildableOverride is disabled, you will not be able to stack buildables.\n"
    "Note that courses that are valid (built with buildableOverride disabled) are considered\n"
    "''pure courses'', and are good since they'll load even a non-oc environment.\n"
    "\n"
    "For OC mods < v2.0, to spawn group, use '/spawnUp', '/spawnDown', and '/spawn' in the same sense as '/groupUp',\n"
    "etc.  Spawn grouping is used to stack buildables correctly.  Spawn group the lowest buildable with the lowest\n"
    "group, and each buildable higher needs to use a higher group.  Since version 2.0, stacking is done automatically,\n"
    "and these commands don't exist.\n"
    "\n"
    "For OC mods <  v2.0, cheating would be done in editoc mode with the commands !cheat-(noclip|god|notarget|speed).\n"
    "For OC mods >= v2.0, cheating is done in the same manner as cheating in devmap mode, and the above admin commands\n"
    "don't exist.\n"
