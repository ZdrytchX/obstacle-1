MG Development

MGDev is where the balance changes planned for Tremulous 1.2 are tested.
The project operates under the direction Norfenstein and is maintained by
Mercenaries Guild - http://www.mercenariesguild.net

Contacting Us

Our preferred medium for bug reports, feature requests, or other issues, is at
our online tracker:

http://projects.mercenariesguild.net/projects/show/mgdev

You'll have to register before you can post new issues, however, so if you'd
rather not have the bother then you can find us on IRC at #mercenariesguild
on freenode, or contact mgdev@mercenariesguild.net.

If you just want to chat about what you've seen or request the presence of an
administrator, IRC is usually the best place to go. More in-depth discussion
can go on the forum - http://www.mercenariesguild.net/forum - if you prefer.

Getting the source

In every distributed pk3 should be a patch with a matching name. In order to
establish against which revision of Tremulous svn it was taken, read it: the 
header should contain lines something like these:

--- tremulous-r1140/Makefile
+++ mgdev-5dc8c5735c0e55097fe256b006823751dcc02d54/Makefile

which means that the patch was taken between revision 1140 of Tremulous SVN and
an mgdev git revision with the given hash (which you probably won't care about)
When applying the patch, you'll need to use something like:
patch -p1 < mgdev-200812272100.patch

The patch is large and bloated: if you want a cleaner and more convenient way
of getting the source, try our Git server:

git clone git://git.mercenariesguild.net/mgdev.git
